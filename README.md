# ConUHacks5-Calendar

## Inspiration
One of our exams decided to put our exam on a Saturday in order for us to have an even flow of exams during midterms. Although this was a nice offer, another teacher decided to put the exam on the same date. This inspired us to create a platform in which teachers can coordinate exam schedules in the the same week.

## What it does
Takes teacher and student inputs in order to accommodate a schedule that works well for everyone. 

## How we built it
java and eclipse

## Challenges we ran into
compiling specific methods and combining classes... and the optimizing function itself

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning from experience, as a group and through trial and error. Though we did not succeed, we learned how to work in a group environment and had fun!

## What we learned
We need GitHub, and possibly collaborate easily on it

## What's next for Optimizing Exam Schedules
tba - we are to find out!
